how to run:

`pip install flask, requests, yt-dlp`

install ffmpeg from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-essentials.7z

extract to ffmpeg folder (overwrite any present files)

make sure ffmpeg/bin/ exists

run app.py

might not run on macos, sorry (you probably need to change the filepaths in the python files)
